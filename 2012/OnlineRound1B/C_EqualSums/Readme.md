Equal Sums
---

I have a set of positive integers  **S**. Can you find two non-empty, distinct subsets with the same sum?

Note: A subset is a set that contains only elements from  **S**, and two subsets are distinct if they do not have exactly the same elements.

### Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,  **T**.  **T**  test cases follow, one per line. Each test case begins with  **N**, the number of positive integers in  **S**. It is followed by  **N**  distinct positive integers, all on the same line.

### Output

For each test case, first output one line containing "Case #x:", where x is the case number (starting from 1).

-   If there are two different subsets of  **S**  that have the same sum, then output these subsets, one per line. Each line should contain the numbers in one subset, separated by spaces.
-   If it is impossible, then you should output the string "Impossible" on a single line.

If there are multiple ways of choosing two subsets with the same sum, any choice is acceptable.

### Limits

No two numbers in  **S**  will be equal.  
1 ≤  **T**  ≤ 10.  

#### Small dataset

**N**  is  _exactly_  equal to 20.  
Each number in  **S**  will be a positive integer less than 105.  

#### Large dataset

**N**  is  _exactly_  equal to 500.  
Each number in  **S**  will be a positive integer less than 1012.  

### Sample

#### Input
    2
    20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
    20 120 266 858 1243 1657 1771 2328 2490 2665 2894 3117 4210 4454 4943 5690 6170 7048 7125 9512 9600

#### Output
    Case #1:
    1 2
    3
    Case #2:
    3117 4210 4943
    2328 2894 7048
