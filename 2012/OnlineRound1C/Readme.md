Google Code Jam 2012 - Round 1C
---

Round 1C was the last chance to get to round 2, with the top 1000 advancing.

Problem A was an easy graph theory problem, and it was first finished in under 8 minutes! Any algorithm for counting paths between nodes sufficed to solve the problem.

Problem C was a dynamic programming problem, similar to the standard Longest Common Subsequence problem. The input strings each consisted of a small number of runs of equal letters, but each run could be very large. Since the strings can be so large, standard algorithms for solving the LCS problem had to be modified to take advantage of the special form of the input, making this problem much more challenging.

Problem B was a subtle physics problem that turned out to be the hardest in the set. It appears to require dynamic programming with a state that includes the position, velocity, and time of the car. But some careful reasoning shows that there's always an optimal strategy that consists of only two phases -- staying still for a period of time, then using the maximum acceleration, with no braking, until reaching the destination. This simplifies the mathematics considerably, as we only need to figure out how long to wait.

mystic won the round by a comfortable margin, finishing the whole set in under an hour. Congratulations to the 1000 advancers!
