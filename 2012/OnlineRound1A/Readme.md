Google Code Jam 2012 - Round 1A
---

Round 1A had two fairly approachable problems and one quite difficult problem. Solving the first two problems within two hours and fifteen minutes was sufficient to advance.

Problem A was a straightforward simulation with probabilities. A greedy algorithm can be used for Problem B.

Problem C was a constraint satisfaction problem, and was quite challenging to implement in time. Only 22 people solved the large input.

SnapDragon got first place, completing problems A and B in 15 minutes each and problem C in 45 minutes. He was followed by pieguy, dzhulgakov, squark, wata, Plagapong, and omeometo all finishing within two hours.
