Google Code Jam 2011 - Qualification Round
------------------------------------------

### Contest Analysis

Google Code Jam 2011 is off to a huge start, with record-setting numbers across the board: we had a 10,336 qualifiers, out of 14,397 people who downloaded at least one input and 21,940 people who logged into the dashboard. Our contestants hailed from 130 different countries, and used 62 languages, though we aren't sure we'd recommend all of them in later rounds. This year there seems to be something of a competition to see who can use the most programming languages; contestant  **foxlit**  is tracking them on his site at  [http://www.go-hero.net/jam/11/multilang](http://www.go-hero.net/jam/11/multilang)  (warning: not all programming languages have family-friendly names).

We hope that you enjoyed the problems. Many contestants noticed that three of them had references to games. That wasn't planned; the judges are just playful people by nature.
