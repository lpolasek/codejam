Google Code Jam 2011 - Round 1A

### Contest Analysis

Round 1 was off to a rather brutal start. The scoreboard quickly started filling up with incorrect submissions on all three problems. It took almost 40 minutes for somebody to solve Problem B and over two hours for a correct solution to problem C to appear.

At the end, a significant number of large submissions turned out to be incorrect as well, which caused a lot of reshuffling at the top of the score board.

Some of the confusion in problem B was caused by a sentence that was not as clear as we would have liked. We are sorry that it took us almost two hours to understand the confusion, and we had to broadcast a clarification message.

krijgertje ended up being the first to solve all problems correctly with 27 minutes to go. Progbeat followed soon after and took second place, only to be overtaken 15 minutes later by Myth. No one else managed to solve all of the problems.

Congratulations to the top 1000 contestants. They have advanced to Round 2. Everyone else has two more chances in rounds 1B and 1C.
