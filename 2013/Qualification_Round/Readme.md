Google Code Jam 2013 - Qualification Round
------------------------------------------

Google Code Jam 2013 is off and running! We have 17059 advancers out of 21962 people who correctly solved at least one input, and 45754 registrants. All those numbers are records for us!

We started with Tomek's variation on a game for children (who is this Tomek anyway?!), and then quickly delved into the riddles of lawnmowers, palindromes, and pirates. Overall, it was a pretty tough set this year, with problem D in particular being something that could have been a Finals problem. A huge congratulations to the 63 people who managed to solve everything!

There are three more rounds to go before the Finals, and we're just getting started. We hope to see all the advancers in the First Rounds!
